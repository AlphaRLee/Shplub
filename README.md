## Behind the Scenes
This project is an evolution off a previous hackathon, [Tama-got-u](https://github.com/RatikKapoor/tama-got-u). It also is an opportunity to learn a new tech stack (i.e. TypeScript in React).

## Developing
Run `npm run build` to transpile TypeScript code to JS and `npx webpack-dev-server` to run on http://localhost:8080.
